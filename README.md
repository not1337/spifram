  A Raspberry Pi SPI Access Library using the Linux Kernel 
=============================================================

This is a small access library for MB85RS64V SPI FRAM based
breakout boards available e.g. from Adafruit. It does not do
direct hardware access from userspace as most other libraries
but uses the SPI kernel interface.

See the file HOWTO.txt for details on how to use this stuff.
