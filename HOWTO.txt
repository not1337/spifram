Using the Adafruit SPI FRAM breakout with a Raspberry Pi

- get an Adafruit SPI FRAM breakout (MB85RS64V chip, 8KB FRAM)
- connect: VCC to P1-17, GND to P1-25, SCLK to P1-23, MISO to P1-21,
  MOSI to P1-19 and CS to P1-24
- Make sure that "dtparam=spi=on" is not commented in /boot/config.txt
  and reboot if necessary
- You can access the FRAM now using bus=0 and device=0 with this library

Note: The 10^12 cycles are for any access to each byte, so if you happily
read the FRAM fast and often you will break the chip.

For the return values of the id function as well as the status register
functionality do consult the MB85RS64V datasheet, though usually you
won't need that functionality.

If you use a userspace direct access library to access the SPI bus you
will break the kernel SPI functionality and thus the included library.
After accessing the SPI bus with such a library you will thus have to
reboot to be able to use the included library again.
